## Instructions

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`
2. Start your server using `npm start`
3. Navigate to app in [browser](http://localhost:3000)
4. For a expired wallet address use `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e` and for non expired use `0x777DD061b3F9865a3aD9875EFca52e3906370e2d` or any of the public accounts on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/accounts)

## Discussion

I used the following technologies: React, Axios, ReactStrap, and ReactIcons.
This app was generated using [create-react-app](https://goo.gl/26jfy4).


## Requirements

#### Create a dashboard interface (React / Angular / VueJs) using the given designs.

I added a `search bar` component that allows the user to use multiple different wallet addresses as well.

#### Implement given server endpoints to the frontend. 

All endpoints are accessible via interacting with the app on the browser.
